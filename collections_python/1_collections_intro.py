#Introduction to collections_python
#collection2 is used to store multi value data

#List = [] ordered changeable and duplicates allowed

#set = {} unordered immutable and duplicate not allowed

#tuple = () ordered unchangeable and Duplicates allowed faster

list1=[8,7,9,3,5,6,9,6,3,1]#List in python
set1={8,7,9,3,5,6,9,6,3,1}#set in python
tuple1=(8,7,9,3,5,6,9,6,3,1)#tuple

print(list1)
print(set1)
print(tuple1)
